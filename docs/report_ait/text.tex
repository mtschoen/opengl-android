\section{Description} % (fold)
\label{sec:Description}
The aim of this application is to be an always ready advisor, which will
present how a knot looks like. 

"Knots animator" should  allow users to display the set of knots from different angle
and furthermore the application should offer rendering of knots binding.

% section Description (end)

\section*{Problem definition} % (fold)
\label{sec:Problem definition}
Climbers have to use knots a lot. It is difficult to learn them all
and it is even harder to explain it by words.

I experienced several times a situation when pair of climbers
where arguing how to bind a knot or how the knot should look like 
before belaying each other 30 meters above a ground.

It will be really handy to have not only a learning tool
how to bind all necessary knots, but also a reference, 
which can be understandable to every one.
% section* Problem definition (end)


\section*{Solution} % (fold)
\label{sec:Solution}

The animator allows user to more easily understand how one of the knots is binded.
Different points of view together with zooming allows to inspect the models in detail. 
In order to achieve good quality of 3D rendering, "Knots animator" 
uses OpenGL ES and also a full screen mode. 
The option of running the application as a screen saver could be really interesting
for passionate climbers.

Last but not least the application loads knots definitions from a obj files,
which allowed application easily deploy additional sets of knots to customers.
Moreover, the users can define knots or other models on their own in Blender.
In fact, Knot animator is Wavefront obj viewer with additional features.

\section*{Target users} % (fold)
\label{sec:Target users}
Target users can be found among climbers and outdoor lovers,
which likes nicely looking and simple to use applications.  
I suppose that especially climbing instructors will appreciate
to have additional learning tool, library of created knots and possibility 
of designing the models of knots easily according a guide themselves in Blender. 

Another target group of users are people who already have 3D models and can export them 
to OBJ format(with precomputed normals). Among them for example I count architects, who 
would like to have the possibility of render their designed models even on a mobile phone.

\end{figure}

Furthermore, anybody who can design any 3D model and exporting it in Wavefront obj
format, can use Knot Animator like 3D visualisation tool.

\section*{Technology used} % (fold)
\label{sec:Technology used}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Android - target platform 
  \item Android SDK - Java framework for Android
  \item Android NDK - Native framework for Android
  \item OpenGL ES 2.0 - graphical engine restricted to Android
  \item XML - definition language 
\end{itemize}

The Knot animator is an Android application, 
which user interface was developed by using Android SDK framework.
Nevertheless the crucial part of knot rendering uses OpenGL ES 2.0,
which is a restricted OpenGL graphical engine for Android devices.

As I decided to render 3D graphics, the choice of OpenGL came naturally.
The OpenGL ES 2.0 engine provides both necessary functionality and due to
native implementation also a better performance.
OpenGL ES 2.0 does not support statical rendering pipeline, 
but only programmable pipeline. \footnote{OpenGL ES 1.0 support only statical pipeline}
As a consequence I have to implement our own vertex and fragment shaders.
It means that shades, lights, blending and lot more has to be implemented by a programmer.
On the other hand, I can adjust complexity of shaders according our needs.

In order to interface OpenGL from C++ I use JNI (Java Native Interface) wrapper.
You can learn more about why I do not access directly fro Java in Subsection~\ref{sec:problems}.

\section*{Architecture} % (fold)
\label{sec:Architecture}


At First, let us have a look at the GUI interface of Knot Animator.
In the~Figure~\ref{pic:navigation} you can see that the rendering, rotating and zooming the model
is done by {\it BINDActivity}. The {\it MenuActivity} allows the user to add new model with title
and description to the list of models, delete an existing model from the list or modify the entry of the list.

\section*{Features and Effort} % (fold)
\label{sec:Features and Effort}
Obviously the key feature is to render the knot in 3D using OpenGL ES.
However, OpenGL ES could be used in two different ways on Android platform.

The first possibility is to call OpenGL functions through Java wrapper.
Java wrapper allows programmers to avoid C/C++ programming of OpenGL.
On the other hand, problems with passing parameters, especially preallocated arrays,
force to use programmers to use workarounds.

The second attitude is to use JNI. JNI is also a Java wrapper around C/C++ but does not wrap the OpenGL,
but the whole application logic in class {\it Activity}. 
The possibility to handle application in C/C++ allows developers call OpenGL ES directly from C/C++.

I have chosen to use the second attitude and implement 3D rendering using OpenGL ES 2.0 and JNI.
The main reasons are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Clear interface between OpenGL ES 2.0 and Android application
  \item Big performance improvement
  \item My phone (Android 2.1 update) support OpenGL ES 2.0 only from C/C++.
  \item Scalability of OpenGL ES 2.0 rendering pipeline 
  \item Possibility of code reuse Linux/Windows OpenGL ES 2.0 app in C++
  \item Learning JNI
\end{itemize}

However, the crucial part of this application lies 
in choosing the right data representation for storing the shape of knots.
Most important qualities of the format are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Easily create models in this formats
    \item Textual. As far as I am starting with 3D modeling, 
    I will need to debug it
    \item Understandable
    \item Support animation
\end{itemize}

At the end I choose Wavefront OBJ format. The format does not support animation.
However, I experienced a lot problems with the rendering of 3D model,
so at the end I did not implemented animation of the 3D model at all. Otherwise, OBJ format has all mentioned qualities.

Other features, like a full screen invocation or an animation selection
I do not consider application specific and I expect
to use classical techniques of Android programming.

The "nice to have" features like animation colourising 
or loading knots through specifying XML file are not crucial 
for making decision about architecture of this application. 
I also expect, that their implementation will consume minor time
in meaning of the whole project.

\section*{Technical problems} % (fold)
\label{sec:problems}
I expected most problems in parsing the file with model definition
for storage of the 3D visualisation in OpenGL.

In fact, this assumption was correct, because it was far to general.
I encountered problems in following implementation steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designing format for storing 3D representation of model. Finally, I decided to use some known 3D modeling format. Specifically Wavefront OBJ.
    \item Parse the OBJ file and load it for OpenGL.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item I found out, that Android does not support of accessing file system from C/C++ \footnote{It is possible to load some files through Android.mk like shared library. Access it via unzipping Apk and extract it. Obviously, it is very complicated, unsupported and statical approach.}
            \item I had to parse the OBJ file in Java first and then to pass the data structures through {\bf JNI} to C/C++.
            At the beginning, using and mainly debugging JNI was frustrating for me. 
            \item Transform the space effective structures passed to C++ into larger arrays, which are required by OpenGL.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Debug the programmable pipeline.
\end{itemize}

During testing the application and exploring the technologies I hit several problems.
Some of them I managed to solve, some of them results in giving up implementing some of the features.

For example, I found out that screen savers are totally unsupported in Android. Screen savers
used by vendors like HTC are implemented directly in custom build of Android, which is vendor dependent.
As I mentioned before, I chose Wavefront OBJ format, so I deliberately skipped not to implement animations.

However, I coped with problems like bugs in library for parsing the OBJ file, which I used. 
I discovered the bugs, repaired them. 
I decided to implement some parts of the transformation of OBJ file to data structures for OpenGL in C++.
    
For a long time I had problem dividing the source code in C++ into several parts
and compile it using Android.mk (Android makefile). I made bad presumption about including header files and
only rereading carefully the documentation helped.

Another problem arose when I started programming the OpenGL pipeline.
GLSL(OpenGL Shading Language) is a standard, 
but I found out  only by googling
that Android implementation differs in tiny details (floats are 1.0 instead of 1.0f, etc).
There is no possibility of debugging nor logging the GLSL on Android.

\subsection*{Tools and Hardware problems} % (fold)
The separation of the code allowed me also to reuse the code and compile 
the C++ part like X11 Linux application. I used the X11 application for a debugging
over SSH, because my small notebook does not handle OpenGL 2.0 specification
needed by OpenGL ES 2.0 libraries.

It is worth to mention that current Android Emulator does not support OpenGL, 
I was forced to use my mobile all the time, 
but at the end I consider it an advantage.

Another serious problem of Java/C++ applications on Android 2.1 is a lack of support for C++ debugging.
For NDK8 is not possible to debug the C++ part, 
and even the building requires complicated setup.\footnote{Luckily, I found tutorial \href{http://mhandroid.wordpress.com/2011/01/23/using-eclipse-for-android-cc-development/}{Eclipse for C development} }
So the only debugging tool were LogCat, pen and paper.

\section{Summary} % (fold)
\label{sec:Summary}
Knot animator is application which allows in current state viewing whichever Wavefront OBJ file
with precomputed normals. I provided the application with default set of 3 knots with their description

\subsection*{Additional features} % (fold)
\label{sec:Additional freatures}
At first, all the features I had intended to implement and I did not are worth to implementing at first.
Another nice feature how to enrich this application is to implement
a voice advisor, who will give you spoken instruction during the animation.
