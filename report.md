# Problem definition #

{sec:Problem definition} Climbers have to use knots a lot. It is difficult to learn them all and it is even harder to explain it by words.

I experienced few times a situation when pair of climbers were arguing how to bind a knot before belaying each other 30 meters above a ground.

It will be really handy to have not only a learning tool how to bind all necessary knots, but also a reference, which can be understandable quickly to every one.

# User stories #

{sec:User stories}

**As a user, I want to press a button and launch Knot animator.** As a user, I want in running Knot animator press options button and view settings.
**As a user, I want to choose knots via &quot;Knot selections&quot; in opened settings.** As a user, I want to set up Knot animator as a screen saver by pressing button in opened settings.
**As a user, I want to press the cancel button in order to see the last knot.** As a user, I want to view knot in 3D after choosing the knot.
**After start, a user will see a default knot in 3D as if he chose it manually.** As a user, I want to set up the default knot on the screen launched from the opened settings.
**As a user, I want to just click the display knot in order to see the animation how the knot is binded.** As a user, I want to click the display to stop the animation.
**As a user, I want to press the cancel button in order to stop the animation and back display the knot.** As a user, I have to see one of the knots and press cancel button.

# Solution and description of the project #

{sec:Solution} The aim of this application is to be an always ready advisor, which will present even to a child how a knot can be bind.

&quot;Knots animator&quot; should allow users to display the set of knots from different angle and furthermore the application should offer rendering of knots binding.

Different points of view together with colourisation of the knots bindings allows user to more easily understand how one the knots are binded. In order to achieve good quality of 3D rendering, &quot;Knots animator&quot; uses OpenGL ES and also a full screen mode. The option of running the application as a screen saver could be really interesting for passionate climbers.

Last but not least the application loads knots definitions from a XML files, which allows application easily deploy additional sets of knots to customers. Moreover the users can define knot on their own.

# Target users #

{sec:Target users} Target users can be found among climbers and outdoor lovers, which likes nicely looking and simple to use applications. I suppose that especially climbing instructors will appreciate to have additional learning tool.

# Technology used #

{sec:Technology used}

**Android - target platform** Android SDK - Java framework for Android
**Android NDK - Native framework for Android** OpenGL ES 1.0 - graphical engine restricted to Android
**XML - definition language**

The Knot animator is an Android application, thats user interface was developed by using Android SDK framework. Nevertheless the crucial part of knot rendering uses OpenGL ES 1.0, which is a little restricted OpenGL graphical engine for Android devices.

As we decided to render 3D graphics, the choice of OpenGL came naturally. The OpenGL ES 1.0 engine provides both necessary functionality and due to native implementation also a better performance.

In order to interface OpenGL we use JNI (Java Native Interface) wrapper. You can learn more about why we do not access directly fro Java in Subsection Â {Used technology}.

# Architecture #

{sec:Architecture} The Knot animator has simple application logic with clearly divided tasks.

**First of all we store the knot definitions in XML files, so the Knot animator has to able parse the definition XML file of every knot.** Secondly in order to interact with user input and other applications the application implements Activities { TodoActivity1}, {TodoActivity2}.
**The crucial part of application is rendering the 3D animation. We use OpenGL ES 1.0, JNI in classes {TODO viewerGL} {JNI wrapper}.**

# Features and Effort #

{sec:Features and Effort} Obviously the key feature is to render the knot in 3D using OpenGL ES. However, OpenGL ES could be used in two different ways on Android platform.

The first possibility is to call OpenGL functions through Java wrapper. Java wrapper allows programmers to avoid C/C++ programming of OpenGL. On the other hand, problems with passing parameters, especially preallocated arrays, force to use programmers to use workarounds.

The second attitude is to use JNI. JNI is also a Java wrapper around C/C++ but does not wrap the OpenGL, but the whole application logic in class { Activity}. The possibility to handle application in C/C++ allows developers call OpenGL ES directly from C/C++.

We have chosen to use the second attitude and implement 3D rendering using OpenGL ES and JNI. The main reasons are:

**Clear interface between OpenGL ES and Android application** Possible performance improvement
**Possibility of code reuse (I would like to build classic OpenGL app in C)** Learning JNI

However the crucial part of this application lies in choosing the right data representation for storing the shape of knots.

I expect most problems in designing as well as parsing XML file for storage of the 3D visualisation.

Others features like full screen invocation or animation selection I consider not application specific and I expect to use classical techniques of Android programming.

The &quot;nice to have&quot; features like animation colourising or viewpoint change are not crucial for making decision about architecture of this application. I also expect, that their implementation will consume minor time in meaning of the whole project.
